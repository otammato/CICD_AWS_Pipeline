# CICD_AWS_Pipeline
create a CI/CD pipeline with AWS CodePipeline
<br><br>

CI/CD refers to the practice of continuously integrating and continuously deploying code. Creating a pipeline streamlines the process of releasing new software versions by automating tasks such as building the code, running tests, and deploying it securely. In this instance, We will be utilizing Github for the source code and an S3 bucket for the final deployment stage.

### Prerequisites:
- AWS account
